Diamante
========

This mod seeks to return the fun, value, and utilities to diamonds!

## Reasoning

Diamonds have been slowly losing value as time goes on!  
Finding this once precious gemstone is now an "oh yeah cool" moment!  
They're everywhere! From buried treasure to end cities!  
And their spotlight is shifting! Netherite may cost diamonds, but it's still taken the spotlight as the important one...  
Think! If you had to choose between a diamond and a netherite block, which one would you choose?  
And all it makes is slightly better armor! There's hardly any utility, but everyone wants it!  
This cannot continue...
